        <!-- Example shows how to exclude classes from Spotbugs scan based on a regular expression.
             This example excludes from scan the bug pattern NP_UNWRITTEN_FIELD in all classes which name ends with
             "ExcludeSample".

             Pattern-based exclusions (as opposed to annotation-based exclusions in a particular class) are mostly
             useful when dealing with classes automatically generated by third-party tools. Usually we can not modify
             how classes are automatically generated, even if they contain some pattern Spotbugs finds dangerous.
             It makes little sense to flood scan results with warning we can not do anything about, better to suppress
             such warnings.
